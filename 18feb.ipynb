    "\n",

    "Architecture: REST is an architectural style that uses a stateless client-server communication model. It relies on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data operations.\n",
    "Characteristics: Stateless, scalable, and loosely coupled.\n",
    "Data Format: Typically uses lightweight formats such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):\n",

    "Architecture: SOAP is a protocol that defines a set of rules for structuring messages. It uses XML for message formatting and relies on other protocols such as HTTP for message negotiation.\n",
    "Characteristics: Stateful, more rigid structure, and often used in enterprise-level applications.\n",
    "Data Format: Uses XML for message format.\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP messages are typically larger and more complex than REST messages, leading to higher overhead.\n",
    "Performance: Due to its XML-based nature, SOAP can be slower and consume more bandwidth.\n",
    "Tight Coupling: SOAP services are tightly coupled, making it more challenging to evolve and update systems independently.\n",
